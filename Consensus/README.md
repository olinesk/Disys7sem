# How to run the program

To run the program you will need to have three seperate terminals open.

When you have your terminals ready, write this command in each terminal:

    go run . X

where in each terminal you switch out *X* with different integers (ex. 0, 1, 2).

Here after the terminals will run on their own until connection is closed.
